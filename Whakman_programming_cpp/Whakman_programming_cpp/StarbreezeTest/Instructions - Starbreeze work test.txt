Starbreeze Work Test -- Gameplay Programmer
============================================

The Task
--------

The task is to create Whakman, a simple Pacman like game using C++ and 
the supplied SBZWhakman library.
You can choose to do a simple Pacman clone, a Pacman game with
some kind of twist or a completely different game. Choose whatever is
more interesting to you. To help you get started, take a look at example.cpp
in the Example project.

Submit the finished project to us, together with a short note English. 
In the note you should tell us what we should look for inyour submission,
what you are the most proud of in the implementation and
what you wanted to have done better.

NOTE:
* Regarding the odd project setup
Originally the project setup wasn't given as part of the test and we also
didn't give the code in WhakmanLibrary project, instead you only got
a dll and the sbzwhakman.h file.

Later on we decided to simplify everything by just giving you the whole
solution. This is why the WhakmanLibrary project builds a dll and
why that project is using a different coding style.
